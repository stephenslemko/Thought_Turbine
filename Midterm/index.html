            <p class="ridefont">Take to the streets of England. You can lay rubber
              downtown as you make daring passes around blind city corners. Or
              marvel at the open world as you drive through the quaint countryside.
              All while behind the wheel of a car you could only dream of driving! Road
              racing classes have been expanded to include Street racing and Drifting. Now
              with over 450 different cars to choose from 97 different manufactorer's
              and custom builders you're bound to find your favourite ride.

            <h2 class="rideTitle">Dirt</h2>
            <p class="ridefont">If pavement is too mainstream don't fret. The open
               world is full of dirt tracks, complete with hairpin turns, air
               catching lips, and plenty of obsticles. Rally racing is integral to
               the Forza Horizon 4 experience! With tons of real world rally championship
               cars ready to hit the gravel, and plenty of factory cars just waiting
               for you to give custom rally paint schemes too, Ott TÃ¤nak would be proud.

           <p class="ridefont">Who needs roads anyway? A whole class of all-terrain
           racing is waiting for you. Crash through fences, splash through rivers,
            knock down anything (or anyone) in your way. Whatever it takes to make
            it to the finish! Cross country races are a fantastic way to take in the
            sweeping landscapes of britain. With plenty of custom styled vehicles
            complete with a lack of doors and plenty of roll bars you'll bound to
            have fun, even if you end up on the well supported roof!</p>

            Forza Horison 4 is set in Britian, or at least something
            like Britain. The country side is remeniscient of everywhere from the
            highlands in Scotland to the busy hubs of Bristol. The designers managed to
            model exact roads and buildings, yet the world is unique to itself. Get
            behind the wheel and come explore, you might just find an old classic
            hiding in a barn waiting to be revived.<br><br>
            <span>Seasons</span><br><br>
            Watch as the stunning backgrounds change with the
            seasons. Bask in the orange glow of autumn, as you drift among the fallen
            leaves. Be prepared for the snow covered roads with the blistering winter.
            Get ready to grip the pavement in the heat of summer. Can you handle
             the slick roads of spring? Some race types are only available during
             particular seasons!<br><br>
            <span>Daily online Events</span><br><br>
            Everyday new online matches are set up. No need to
            enter a lobby, online races will have warnings that pop up in game telling
            you the start time and location of the race. You can choose to take part,
            or you can traverse the open world looking for barn finds or offline
            single player races. Difficulty is always scaled and competing cars are
            choosen based on your current ride to make the race competetive.<br><br>
            <span>Showcase Events</span><br><br>
            As you complete races and gain scene credits you'll unlock special
            show case events. In these events you'll gain access to one time only races.
            What you'll be driving is a mystery before hand, and your opponents may seem unconventional.
            Have you ever raced a train down a mountain? How about an entire crew
            of motocross riders through a strip mine? Will you be able to finish first?
            The only way to know is to buckle up and start racing.
